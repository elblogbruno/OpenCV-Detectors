# OpenCV Detectors
This is an app I developed during my internship at CVC (Computer Vision Center) at UAB University back in 2018 when I was 16 years old.
It has got this types of detectors:

* Face Detector
* Face Detector (DNN Based)
* Object Detector (DNN Based)
* Pose detector (DNN Based)

And allows you to switch beetween them in real time aswell as take photos and share them!
## Would like to try it?
[DOWNLOAD APK FROM HERE](https://mega.nz/file/1Z01AIJb#PXVpzbEm3Vi3y0hBrMLLsgATdslIrPl9TQGw38UJCBs)
or COMPILE IT FROM ANDROID STUDIO
## Compiling app instructions
To make use of the app you need to:
1. Clone the project: `git clone https://github.com/elblogbruno/OpenCV-Detectors`
2. Open the project with android studio
3. Take a cofee and wait for gradle to load everything
4. Make the project (click on the green Hammer icon)
5. Download all the pre-trained neural networks and files from here: [MEGA LINK](https://mega.nz/folder/oNNUgCZR#Hgu_6ysIEs8p4heuDjZ9DA)
6. Go to `app > build > intermediates > assets > debug` and copy everything that you downloaded there. If folder does not exist re-run step 4.
7. Connect your phone and build!
8. Enjoy!
9. (Optional) Give feedback on what I may need to improve to get more FPS or improve it in general.
